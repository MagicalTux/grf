GRF library
===========
http://www.grfbuilder.com/

This library is NOT opensource, but is free to use.

You can submit bugs by mailing me (magicaltux@ookoo.org).

If you use my library, you can drop me an email, it'll give me more motivation
and will allow you to have more updates :)

Running GrfBuilder on Linux without installing the GRF lib
==========================================================

By default, the Linux system will try to load the GRF library from system's
library path (/lib, /usr/lib, etc). You can override this by using the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environnement variable.
Running GrfBuilder would be done by typing :

 $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./grfbuilder.bin

Audio support on Linux with Qt
==============================

You need to compile your Qt library and include NAS support.

Gentoo:
echo "x11-libs/qt nas" >>/etc/portage/package.use

Configure: add option -system-nas-sound
